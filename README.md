# Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.

Diabetes is a type of chronic disease which is more common among the people of all
age groups. Predicting this disease at an early stage can help a person to take the
necessary precautions and change his/her lifestyle accordingly to either prevent the
occurrence of this disease or control the disease.

We will be taking the Pima Indians diabetes dataset and pre-process it with an
objective to employ machine learning for prediction of diabetes. We will use 8
Machine Learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
XgBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM ), Logistic regression , K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network and apply these algorithms on the dataset to
predict the disease. Then we will compare the result of these algorithms according to
